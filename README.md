# Linked-Lists-in-C
Purpose of Software:
	
	This program manipulates records of employees, which are stored with their 
	ID, First Name and Family Name.

Developer Name and Development Date:
	
	Cameron Hawtin
	November 26/17

Organization:
	
	The software is several files, with 2 header files 2 .c files, several .o files
	and makefiles.
	Nearly all of the the code added by myself was in the linked_list.c file.
Compilation:
	
	Main test program:
	Type the following into console:
		
		make -f Makefile
	
	Run by then typing "main_test" (or ./main_test) into console




	Second test program:
	Type the following into console:
		make -f Makefile_leak
	Run by then typing "main_test_delete" (or ./main_test_delete) into console




Issues: 
	
	-There is a small issue with the "deleteNodeByName" function 
	-The makefiles were incorrect so they had to be tweaked
	-Issues with main_test_delete program (may be problems with given makefile too?)

Software Use:
	
	Simply run the test programs as shown above. Press enter to move through the outputs.
